# Apache IceBerg
Apache Iceberg is a data format and table management system that was designed to address some of the limitations of the Apache Parquet and Apache ORC data formats. It was developed by the Apache Software Foundation as part of the Apache Iceberg project, which aims to improve data management on data lakes and other large-scale data storage systems.

# Python Library
# Import the necessary libraries
import iceberg

# Connect to the Iceberg table
table = iceberg.read().load("/path/to/iceberg/table")

# Read the data from the table
data = table.to_pandas()
